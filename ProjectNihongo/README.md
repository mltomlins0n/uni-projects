# ProjectNihongo | 日本語 = Nihongo = Japanese Language

## Final Year Uni Project

**A game/learning tool prototype created in Unreal Engine which aims to determine the effect of gamification on language learning.**

## Abstract
Easing the difficulty of learning Japanese while promoting engagement and motivation in a learner’s study forms the aim of this project. This is tackled through researching both E-learning and gamification, identifying which principles of each are applicable in designing and developing a series of language learning mini games. The advantages and disadvantages of E-learning are assessed, as are the features of existing gamified systems. A number of approaches are discussed and requirements of the software identified.

The project’s development is carried out using the Unreal Engine and testing performed throughout. User testing is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the product, to determine if it achieves its objectives of providing support to a learner’s studies and being accessible to those with no prior experience of the language. Results from user testing were positive but suffered from a smaller than intended sample size. Fortunately, the sample group included users both with and without experience of Japanese. The product was deemed easy to use, fun, and something users would consider using alongside their studies. 

The study concludes that some elements of E-learning proved useful in the project and incorporating them in the design of the mini games was beneficial to the work. Certain elements and methods of gamification were also of value in helping the project achieve its objectives. Feedback from user testing further supported these conclusions and provided a direction for continuation of the project work. The project appears successful overall but would is smaller in scope than intended due in part to time pressure. More work would be especially beneficial in creating a project closer to what was initially envisaged.
